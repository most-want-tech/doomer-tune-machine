## üìã What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Authenticate with GitKraken (Required for automation)

To enable automated GitHub issue creation in the future, click this link:

**[Click Here to Sign In to GitKraken](vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/integrations/connect?id=github&source=mcp)**

Or run in terminal:
```bash
gk auth login
```

### Step 2: Create the GitHub Issue Manually

Since we need authentication first, please create the issue manually:

1. **Go to GitHub Issues:**
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/most-want-tech/doomer-tune-machine/issues
   - Click "New Issue"

2. **Copy the Template:**
   - Open: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` (in this workspace)
   - Copy the entire content (starting after "Copy and paste this into GitHub Issue:")

3. **Paste and Customize:**
   - Title: `[REFACTOR] App.tsx: Break down monolithic component into feature-based architecture`
   - Paste the template into the description
   - Update the branch links to use the correct branch URL format

4. **Add Labels:**
   - `refactor`
   - `enhancement`
   - `documentation`
   - `priority: high`

5. **Assign:**
   - Assignee: Yourself (@hstrejoluna or your username)
   - Project: `doomermixerplus` (if you have a project board)

### Step 3: Link Branch to Issue

After creating the issue, you can link it:

**Option A: In GitHub UI**
- On the issue page, look for "Development" in the right sidebar
- Click "Create a branch" or "Link a branch"
- Select the existing branch: `refactor/app-component-architecture`

**Option B: Reference in Branch Description**
- Edit the issue description
- Add: `Branch: refactor/app-component-architecture`
- Or reference in a comment: `Branch created: refactor/app-component-architecture`

## üéØ Understanding the Plan

### Current State
- **App.tsx:** 894 lines
- **Problem:** Monolithic component handling too many concerns
- **Impact:** Hard to maintain, test, and collaborate on

### Target State
- **App.tsx:** ~120 lines (86% reduction!)
- **Architecture:** Feature-based modules
- **Benefits:** 
  - 20+ reusable components
  - 15+ testable units
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Better performance optimization opportunities

### Implementation Approach

**7 Phases** (13-16 hours total):

1. **Phase 1:** Layout Components (1 hour) - Simple, low-risk start
2. **Phase 2:** Audio Player (2-3 hours) - Core functionality extraction
3. **Phase 3:** Effects (3-4 hours) - Largest reduction via generic component
4. **Phase 4:** Presets (2 hours) - KV storage abstraction
5. **Phase 5:** Export (3 hours) - Audio & video export features
6. **Phase 6:** Waveform (1 hour) - Minor reorganization
7. **Phase 7:** Final Cleanup (1-2 hours) - Polish and integration

**Each phase:**
- Gets its own branch (`refactor/phase-X-description`)
- Has a separate PR for easy review
- Can be merged independently
- Maintains app functionality

## üöÄ Getting Started with Phase 1

Once the issue is created, you can start Phase 1:

```bash
# Create Phase 1 branch
git checkout refactor/app-component-architecture
git checkout -b refactor/phase-1-layout-components

# Create the layout components
mkdir -p src/components/layout
touch src/components/layout/app-header.tsx
touch src/components/layout/app-footer.tsx

# Implement the components (extract from App.tsx)
# ... code here ...

# Commit with clear message
git add .
git commit -m "refactor(phase-1): extract layout components

- Create AppHeader component with title and description
- Create AppFooter component with credits
- Update App.tsx to use new components
- Reduces App.tsx by 30 lines

Part of #[ISSUE_NUMBER]"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin refactor/phase-1-layout-components
```

Then create a PR using the template in the workflow guide!

## ‚ùì FAQs

**Q: Can I skip phases?**
A: No, phases build on each other. Follow the order for best results.

**Q: What if I find a better approach during implementation?**
A: Document it! Update the plan and discuss in the PR. The plan is a guide, not a contract.

**Q: How do I handle merge conflicts?**
A: Since we're on a feature branch, regularly merge `dev` into your phase branch to stay updated.

**Q: Should I add tests for every component?**
A: Yes! Add tests as you create components. Don't defer testing to the end.

**Q: What if Phase 3 takes longer than estimated?**
A: That's okay! Estimates are guidelines. Update the issue with actual time spent.
